  <br>
</h1>

 - Simple and modular code base making it easy to contribute.
 - Fast And fully configurable flags to probe mutiple elements.
 - Supports multiple HTTP based probings.
 - Smart auto fallback from https to http as default. 
 - Supports hosts, URLs and CIDR as input.
 - Handles edge cases doing retries, backoffs etc for handling WAFs.

# Installation Instructions


### From Binary

The installation is easy. You can download the pre-built binaries for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/releases/) page. Extract them using tar, move it to your `$PATH`and you're ready to go.

```sh
Download latest binary from https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/releases

▶ tar -xvf httpx-linux-amd64.tar
▶ mv httpx-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/httpx
▶ httpx -h
```

### From Source

httpx requires **go1.14+** to install successfully. Run the following command to get the repo - 

```sh
▶ GO111MODULE=on go get -v github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx
```

### From Github

```sh
▶ git clone https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx.git; cd httpx/cmd/httpx; go build; mv httpx /usr/local/bin/; httpx -version
```

# Usage

```sh
httpx -h
```

### Running httpx with stdin  

This will run the tool against all the hosts and subdomains in `hosts.txt` and returns URLs running HTTP webserver. 

```sh
▶ cat hosts.txt | httpx 

    __    __  __       _  __
   / /_  / /_/ /_____ | |/ /
  / __ \/ __/ __/ __ \|   /

# 📋 Notes

- As default, **httpx** checks for `HTTPS` probe and fall-back to `HTTP` only if `HTTPS` is not reachable.
- For printing both HTTP/HTTPS results, `no-fallback` flag can be used.
- Custom scheme for ports can be defined, for example `-ports http:443,http:80,https:8443`
- `vhost`, `http2`, `pipeline`, `ports`, `csp-probe`, `tls-probe` and `path` are unique flag with different probes.
- Unique flags should be used for specific use cases instead of running them as default with other flags.
- When using `json` flag, all the information (default probes) included in the JSON output.


# Thanks

httpx is made with 🖤 by the [projectdiscovery](https://projectdiscovery.io) team. Community contributions have made the project what it is. See the **[Thanks.md](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/blob/master/THANKS.md)** file for more details. Do also check out these similar awesome projects that may fit in your workflow:
